- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** For robust, type-safe JavaScript development.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** For a fast and modern frontend build tooling experience.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** For a utility-first CSS framework.
- **[Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/):** For packaging and distributing the Electron application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended, v22 used in CI)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation & Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tianqueal/llauncher-electron.git
    cd llauncher-electron
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**

    For local development, LLauncher may require certain environment variables to be set, primarily for defining external resource URLs. These are **not hardcoded into the application** for security and flexibility reasons.

    Instead, create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Then, edit the newly created `.env` file with your specific local or development URLs.

    **`.env.example`:**

    ```dotenv
    # URLs for game manifests and assets - replace with your actual URLs for local dev
    MANIFEST_URL="YOUR_MANIFEST_URL_HERE"
    ASSET_BASE_URL="YOUR_ASSET_BASE_URL_HERE"
    PATCH_NOTES_BASE_URL="YOUR_PATCH_NOTES_BASE_URL_HERE"
    PATCH_NOTES_URL="YOUR_PATCH_NOTES_URL_HERE"
    VITE_PATCH_NOTES_BASE_URL="YOUR_VITE_PATCH_NOTES_BASE_URL_HERE"

    # Note: For production builds via GitHub Actions, these values are supplied
    # via Repository Variables/Secrets in the GitHub repository settings.
    # Do NOT commit your actual .env file with real values.
    ```

    Ensure your `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits. The application is configured to load these variables from the `.env` file during local development.

4.  **Run in development mode:**
    This will start the application with Vite's development server, enabling hot reloading.
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## üì¶ Building for Production

To create distributable packages for your operating system:

```bash
npm run make
```

This command utilises Electron Forge to build the application based on the configuration in `forge.config.ts`. The output will be located in the `out` directory.
