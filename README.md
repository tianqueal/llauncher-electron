## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended, v22 used in CI)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation & Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tianqueal/llauncher-electron.git
    cd llauncher-electron
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**

    For local development, LLauncher may require certain environment variables to be set, primarily for defining external resource URLs. These are **not hardcoded into the application** for security and flexibility reasons.

    Instead, create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Then, edit the newly created `.env` file with your specific local or development URLs.

    **`.env.example`:**

    ```dotenv
    # URLs for game manifests and assets - replace with your actual URLs for local dev
    ASSET_BASE_URL="YOUR_ASSET_BASE_URL_HERE"
    MANIFEST_URL="YOUR_MANIFEST_URL_HERE"
    PATCH_NOTES_BASE_URL="YOUR_PATCH_NOTES_BASE_URL_HERE"
    PATCH_NOTES_URL="YOUR_PATCH_NOTES_URL_HERE"
    VITE_PATCH_NOTES_BASE_URL="YOUR_VITE_PATCH_NOTES_BASE_URL_HERE"

    # Note: For production builds via GitHub Actions, these values are supplied
    # via Repository Variables/Secrets in the GitHub repository settings.
    # Do NOT commit your actual .env file with real values.
    ```

    Ensure your `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits. The application is configured to load these variables from the `.env` file during local development.

4.  **Run in development mode:**
    This will start the application with Vite's development server, enabling hot reloading.
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## üì¶ Building for Production

To create distributable packages for your operating system:

```bash
npm run make
```

This command utilises Electron Forge to build the application based on the configuration in `forge.config.ts`. The output will be located in the `out` directory.

### Important Note on Environment Variables for Local Production Builds

When building the application locally using `npm run make`, the Vite configuration for the main process (`vite.main.config.ts`) relies on specific environment variables (e.g., `ASSET_BASE_URL`, `MANIFEST_URL`) being present in `process.env` _at the time the Vite configuration is processed_.

The default `vite.main.config.ts` in this project **does not** include logic to automatically load variables from your `.env` file into `process.env` specifically for the `npm run make` command. This behaviour, where environment variables might not be automatically available to the Vite configuration during an Electron Forge `make` process, has been a point of discussion within the Electron Forge community (e.g., issue #3558 in the Electron Forge repository). Consequently, if you run `npm run make` without ensuring these variables are loaded, the resulting application may not function correctly as critical URLs will be undefined.

**To ensure your `.env` file is loaded for local `npm run make` builds:**

1.  Ensure you have a `.env` file at the root of your project containing the necessary environment variables (as described in the "Environment Variables" section under "Installation & Development").

2.  You will need to **modify your `vite.main.config.ts`** to explicitly load this `.env` file. A straightforward solution is to add the following code at the beginning of your `vite.main.config.ts`:

    ```typescript
    // vite.main.config.ts
    // ... existing imports ...
    import dotenv from 'dotenv'; // Add this import
    import path from 'node:path'; // Add this import

    // Add this block to load .env for the 'make' process
    const envPath = path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env'); // Loads from your existing .env file
    const loadResult = dotenv.config({ path: envPath, override: true });

    if (loadResult.error) {
      console.error(
        `[vite.main.config.ts] CRITICAL: Error loading .env file from ${envPath}. This file is required for local 'npm run make' builds to correctly set up environment variables. Error: ${loadResult.error.message}`,
      );
      process.exit(1); // Exit if .env cannot be loaded
    } else {
      console.log(
        `[vite.main.config.ts] Successfully loaded environment variables from ${envPath} for the main process build.`,
      );
    }

    // Existing export default defineConfig...
    export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
      // ... rest of the configuration ...
      return {
        /* ... */
      };
    });
    ```

    With this modification, your existing `.env` file (used for local development with `npm run start`) will also be loaded when you run `npm run make`, ensuring the necessary variables are available.

**Note for CI (GitHub Actions):** In CI environments, these variables are typically injected directly into the build environment (e.g., via repository secrets). The `dotenv` loading block shown above, with its `process.exit(1)` on failure to load `.env`, would cause CI to fail if it couldn't find a `.env` file (which is expected as `.env` files should not be in source control). Therefore, CI environments rely on direct injection of environment variables, and this specific modification to `vite.main.config.ts` is primarily for ensuring consistent local builds. If you need `vite.main.config.ts` to be compatible with both local `.env` loading and CI direct injection without modification, a more nuanced loading logic would be required.
